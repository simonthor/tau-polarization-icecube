This directory contains a number of MC-TESTER tests which can be
performed to validate the currently installed version of TAUOLA 
and it's iterface against a benchmark version. It uses the
example "taumain_pythia_example" so any changes to this will also 
alter the tests. Some variable for the test. eg. number of events
can be changed in test.inc
__________
IMPORTANT: THIS IS TESTING: collisions of antiprotons are in use !

###########################################################################
WARNING: This directory is not adapted to installation scripts for LCG
         as it requires more manual configuration than other examples

Before running any tests from this directory, make sure that:
- all paths (HepMC, MC-TESTER, Pythia8) have been provided when
  configuring TAUOLA/examples
- ROOT is configured properly
- PYTHIA8DATA, MCTESTERLOCATION and HEPMCLOCATION environmental
  variables are set correctly (to Pythia8 xml config files, MC-TESTER
  and HepMC installation directories respectively)
- LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable contains paths to MC-TESTER and HepMC libraries
###########################################################################

To run, compile taumain_pythia_example.c , then type "make" in 
this directory. MC-TESTER booklets can be found in the following 
subdirectories. You can run a single test by typing "make <booklet name>" 
in the corresponding subdirectory.

  tester.H.Pi.mass1.pdf 
  --------------------- 
  The tau decay mode is restricted to tau->pi nu. Interesting plots to
  look at are the invariant mass of the pi+ pi- which should be narrower
  than the case when spin correlations are off.
  The user histograms allow transverse spin correlations to be check.
  Please see documentation for explanation of these.

  tester.H.Pi.mass2.pdf
  ---------------------
  Similar to tester.H.Pi.mass1.pdf but invariant mass squared is plotted
  rather than invariant mass. The user can check that the plot
  of pi- nu nu (which is equivalent to pi+ energy) is flat. ie. no
  polarisation. 

  tester.H.Rho.pdf
  ----------------
  The tau decay mode is restricted to tau->rho nu, rho->pi+/- pi.
  The user histograms are useful for studying the transverse spin effect.
  See documentation for more details.

  tester.HA.Pi.pdf
  ----------------
  The same as tester.H.Pi.mass1.pdf but assuming a scalar-pseudoscalar
  higgs with mixing angle of pi/4.

  tester.HA.Rho.pdf
  -----------------
  The same as tester.H.Rho.pdf but assuming a scalar-pseudoscalar
  higgs with mixing angle of pi/4. 


- Z/

  tester.Z.Pi.mass1.pdf 
  --------------------- 
  Simliar test to tester.H.Pi.mass1.pdf. For the Z the pi+pi-
  invariant mass distribution should be wider than the no-spin case.

  tester.Z.Pi.mass2.pdf
  ---------------------
  Simliar test to tester.H.Pi.mass2.pdf. For the Z case the pi+ 
  energy spectrum should show some polarisation.

- W/
  tester.W+.pdf and tester.W-.pdf
  -------------------------------
  Simliar tests to tester.H.Pi.mass2.pdf. The pi+ (pi-) 
  energy spectrum should show full polarisation.


- H+-/
  tester.H+.pdf	and tester.H-.pdf
  -------------------------------
  Simliar tests to tester.H.Pi.mass2.pdf. The pi+ (pi-) 
  energy spectrum should show full polarisation.
