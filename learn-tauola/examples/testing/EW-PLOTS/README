EW-PLOTS - create SANC-module specific plots.

Note that this program is for debug and testing purposes mainly.

To run:
- Configure and 'make' in the examples directory
- Execute 'make' in the directory 'examples/testing'
- Copy SANC tables into the 'examples/testing/EW-PLOTS' directory.
- Generate Born-level tables using the SANC module
  ( for details see comments in SANC/SANCinterface.cxx )
- Copy the appropriate Born-level table into the 
  'examples/testing/EW-PLOTS' directory as table11-11.txt;

    For example, for PDG ID = 1, the appropriate input files are:

    table1-1.txt   - SANC table for PDG ID = 1
    table11-11.txt - SANC table with Born-level data created for PDG ID = 1

- Execute './plots.exe'
- Execute 'root -b -l draw.C' to create plots

The resulting plots are eqivalent to Fig3a and Fig3b of the paper in pb
Note that we pretabulate d sigma /d cos theta [pb].
It means that the factor of 2pi is already included as well as flux
and spin/color factors.

If stuck on any of these steps, see the documentation or READMEs
of the directories mentioned above.
