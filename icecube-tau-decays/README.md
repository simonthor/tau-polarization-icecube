# Compare tau decays between IceCube and Tauola
This folder contains most of the code necessary for generating and analyzing events for tau decays from IceCube and Tauola, where the tau lepton has been created from a tau neutrino interacting with ice. The code is written in C++ and Python.

## Workflow
The programs used in this directory should be executed in the following order:
